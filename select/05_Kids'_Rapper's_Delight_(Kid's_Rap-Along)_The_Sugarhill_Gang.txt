Yeah, all the kids, right now, come close to the stage
Come close to Sugarhill Gang, right now
We're gonna dance all night long with y'all, come on now
And let me tell you something about this song right here
This song here was the first song
That created the whole rap phenomenon
Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang

Somebody say "Ho" (Ho!)
Say "Ho! Ho!" (Ho! Ho!)
Somebody scream (Ahhh!)

I said a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip, hip, hop and you don't stop
To rock it to the bang, bang, boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test: I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white,
The red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang, bang, the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang, bang, boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well, so far you heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank, come on Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of
The mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a T
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks,
Credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a punk from
The rocker, not a dime 'til I made it again

Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?
I'ma gonna get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?

Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable
Name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and I'm feeling the lows
The beat starts gettin' down your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And moving your body while you're sittin' in the seat
And then jam, you start doing the freak
I said jam, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singing on an' an' on an' on, on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on an' an' on an' on, on an' on
Like a hot butter, pop the pop the pop
Dibbie dibbie, poppy the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just to wiggle your behind
Singin' on an' an' on an' on an' on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on an' an' on an' on on an' on
Rock rock, y'all, get on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put jig-jig-jiggles in your behind
I said one, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what you got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four
Tell me, Wonder Mike, what are you waiting for?

I said a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip, hip, hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang, bang, boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Skiddlee beebop, we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, kids: we love you
'Cause you rock and you roll with so much soul
And you could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on your breakfast toast
Rock it out, uh, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie, the bang, bang, the boogie
To the beat, beat, it's so unique
Come on, kids, let's rock to the beat
