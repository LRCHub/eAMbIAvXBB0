I told her, never in hell, no special reason.
Must a lied 'cause i ain't leavin'.
We're in for a very long night.
Heard a vicious rumor from your mama's tongue:
You a desp'rate woman, need a man with a gun.
High crime zone in the city of lights.
Baby, please!
Can't take it anymore.
Baby, please!
Can't take it anymore.
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight,
And i'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze.
I ain't lookin' for somebody to fight.
Baby, don't get uptight.
Baby, please!
Wanna see my i.d.? try to clip my wings!
Don't have to show you proof of anything.
I know the law friend.
At the 'leventh hour. i'm goin' back outside.
Give it a try.
I'm your last loose end.
Baby, please!
Can't take it anymore.
Baby, please!
Can't take it anymore.
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight
And i'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze.
I ain't lookin' for somebody to fight.
Baby, don't get uptight.
Baby, please!
I feel my heart beat,
Feel my heart beat,
Feel my heart beat,
Oh yeah.
Baby, please!
Can't take it anymore.
Baby, please!
Can't take it anymore.
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight,
And i'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze.
I ain't lookin' for somebody to fight.
Baby, don't get uptight.
Baby, please!
